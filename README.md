# Text_Extractor-Python-

This work is written in Python. It extracts data from an existing text file, produces a new text file, and restricts this new text file to answering just the following questions:

1- What is the software version?
2- How many times was the application launched?
3- Are there any Warning and Error states?
4- If there were any errors, at what time did they occur?

It basically, takes the log file as an input and creating a new text file as an output.
